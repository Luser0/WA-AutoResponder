# WhatsApp AutoResponder
a js noob implementation of [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) to auto respond to any message received

TO DO:

 1. ~~add a whitelist~~
 2. ~~add the ability to remove contacts from the whitelist directly form whatsapp~~
 3. ~~make sure a number can't be added twice to the whitelist~~
 4. ~~add an error msg if you try to remove a non-whitelisted number from the whitelist~~
 5. make the active hours check more friendly
 6. documentation on how to use and the features available
